* "Some of the health data we collect as part of this [insert name of technology product]", Is the "name of the technology product" different from the legal entity name?
* "Privacy: How this technology accesses other data
[If yes] Here is how you can check your settings,
including permissions set as a default...No"
What does this last part "including permissions set as a default...No" mean?

* Is the privacy policy mentioned in "Some of the health data we collect as part of this ... Read our HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices [embed link or popup] for more information." the same privacy policy collected by the [Link to full privacy policy] ?
